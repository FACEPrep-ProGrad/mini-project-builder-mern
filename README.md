In the end of this document, you will find guidelines on how to submit the exercise.

## Instructions

Your task is to build a complete exercise tracker using `react, node js, express and mongoose` for the `ProExercise Tracker` app. Now we would create the backend using node.js. Your application involves the following features, 
- User
- Exercise

**You are free to logically decide and create routes,database schema, frontend based on your application.**

### PROGRESSION 1 | START DESIGNING
Your task in this iteration is to create a complete figma design for the pages.

### PROGRESSION 2 |  START BUILDING
Once the design is confirmed by your `Mentor`. You can right away start with the coding part. Your task in this is iteration is to complete all the backend api end points.

### PROGRESSION 3 | WELCOME PAGE
Your task in this is progression is to create a `SPA` using react
- `Home`
- 'Header`
- `Footer`
- `Main component is the plug and play area for displaying all the content`
- `About Us containing description about your Exercise Tracker app`
- `Navigation compononent inside Header`
- `Contact Us`
In the next stage we will connect frontend and backend.
